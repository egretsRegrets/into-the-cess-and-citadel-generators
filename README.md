# into-the-cess-and-citadel-generators

On-the-fly generator tools for/from _Into the Cess and Citadel_ by Alex Coggon and Charlie Ferguson-Avery.

**NOTE**: To prevent publishing copyright material from _Into the Cess and Citadel_, text from the book will not be included in this repo. The project is more for my own use in running games, but where possible schemas will be exposed to make the generators more usable for othersâ€”though extensive copy-pasting from a copy of the book will be required.
